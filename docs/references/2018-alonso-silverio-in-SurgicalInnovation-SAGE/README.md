## Notes


Laparoscopic trainers and simulators (e.g physical trainers, virtual reality simulators, and hybrid simulators) [7,8]
trainers can be objectively evaluated by an intelligent software [6, 16, 17]

20 participants (4 experts, 6 residends, and 10 medical students) using training system for 5 days with 2 basic taks (transferring and pattern cutting)
Task require hand-eye coordination and spatial perception.
* Transfering virtual reality ponint from one side of the screen to another side with different hegith and orientations
* Following a idea spiral path with the tip of the instrument, simularting the circualr cur in a gauze
