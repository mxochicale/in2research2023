abstract = {Abstract Introduction Development of dexterity, hand-eye coordination and self-assessment are essential during the preclinical training of dental students. To meet this requirement, dental simulators have been developed combining virtual reality with a force feedback haptic interface. The aim of this study was to assess the capability of the VirTeaSy© haptic simulator to discriminate between users with different levels of practical and clinical experience. Materials and Methods Fifty-six volunteers divided into five groups (non-dentists, 1st/3rd/final-year dental students, recent graduates) had three attempts to prepare an occlusal amalgam cavity using the simulator. Percentages of volumes prepared inside (\%IV) and outside (\%OV) the required cavity, skill index and progression rate, referring to the evolution of skill index between trials 1 and 3, were assessed. The dental students and recent graduates completed a questionnaire to gather their opinions about their first hands-on experience with a haptic simulator. Results The results showed no significant difference between the groups at the first attempt. Following the third attempt, the skill index was improved significantly. Analysis of progression rates, characterised by large standard deviations, did not reveal significant differences between groups. The third attempt showed significant differences in skill index and \%IV between 1st-year undergraduate dental students and both non-dentists and recent dental graduates. The questionnaire indicated a tendency for dental operators to consider the simulator as a complement to their learning and not a substitute for traditional methods. Conclusion This study did not show the ability of a basic aptitude test on VirTeaSy© haptic simulator to discriminate between users of different levels of expertise. Optimisations must be considered in order to make simulation-based assessment clinically relevant.},
