    abstract = { Abstract The field of laparoscopic surgery has continued to grow exponentially over the years, prompting new innovative technologies. Despite substantial advancements, standard laparoscopic tools have undergone little design changes and fail to optimize mobility in limited spaces. Advancements in robotics have attempted to address this, allowing for increasing degrees of freedom and articulation of instruments. Even so, this system has proven to be cumbersome with questionable cost-effectiveness. In this study, we present the first use of a solely mechanical intuitively controlled articulating laparoscopic needle driver. The ability to naturally articulate allowed for ease during suturing and knot tying during the critical portions of the operation. The FlexDex surgical instrument demonstrates promise in the field of foregut surgery in addition to other areas of minimally invasive specialties. }
